            <h2>Project Home</h3>
            <p>The SmartCville Housing Data Project aims to analyze how the housing market in Charlottesville has evolved over the past 20 years. In doing so, we hope to understand how real estate values have changed and the potential impact that it has had on the local community. The HUD defines housing affordability as not spending more than 30% of the householdâ€™s income on all housing-related expenses . For many families housing is not affordable, a problem that affects not just the lowest income tier, but families on all income levels. Families earning income that is 50% or less of the area median income of $89,600 (in 2018), have a 65-70% chance of paying more than 30% of their income on housing related expenses . The reality is that if you earn below the area median income or are looking to move closer to the city, your chances of finding affordable housing are slim. Housing in the rural areas surrounding Charlottesville are more affordable, but force families to pay much more for transportation and commuting costs, which significantly impacts the overall cost of living. There is an overall extensive mismatch between housing prices and income. Key problems include a shortage of housing options close to jobs in the urban parts of the Charlottesville area, a general lack of affordable housing, and high construction costs. By talking to professionals and other individuals relevant to housing in Charlottesville, and examining the evolution and growth in real estate (e.g.  sale prices over the past 20-30 years), and identifying trends in the data (e.g. the areas in Charlottesville where the problem of affordable housing may be particularly prevalent), our analysis can help policymakers, stakeholders, and the general public better understand the problem and facilitate a conversation on how to engender change.<br><br>
